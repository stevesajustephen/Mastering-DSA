Frequency Counter Pattern

Often, using a frequency counter will help to avoid using a nested loop, thus reducing the time complexity of our algorithm. Frequency counters can easily take an operation that would be O(N²) down to a much more palatable O(N). The reason that it can be applied to problems that arrays and strings specifically is because strings are considered array-like objects in JavaScript, therefore you can both access and perform operations on an index of a string with the exact same syntax you could use on an array.
