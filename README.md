Frequency Counter Pattern

Often, using a frequency counter will help to avoid using a nested loop, thus reducing the time complexity of our algorithm. Frequency counters can easily take an operation that would be O(N²) down to a much more palatable O(N). The reason that it can be applied to problems that arrays and strings specifically is because strings are considered array-like objects in JavaScript, therefore you can both access and perform operations on an index of a string with the exact same syntax you could use on an array.

Longest Substring with Same Frequency

Find the longest substring where all characters occur the same number of times.

Anagram Mapping

Given two lists of numbers, map each element of the first list to its index in the second list using frequency counts.

Construct Note from Magazine

Check if a ransom note can be constructed from words in a magazine (count frequency of each word).

Permutation in String

Check if a string contains a permutation of another string using frequency counters for sliding windows.
